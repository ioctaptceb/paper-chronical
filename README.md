# Paper Chronical

a short story on paper

This is a learning project for me to better understand things like computer vision and edge detection. I have a ways to go, but this is an initial foray into that world. Hopefully when I have more time I will come back to this.

Basics:
- install dependancies with `npm install`
- run it with `npm start`
- go to `localhost:8080`
- ensure your camera is on
- be in a dark room with a white piece of paper
- things should happen.
